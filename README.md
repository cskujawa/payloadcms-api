# PayloadCMS with Agentic Content Generation

A Docker-based PayloadCMS v3 application enhanced with an intelligent content generation API designed for n8n workflow automation. This system transforms natural language prompts into structured blog posts using AI-powered content generation.

## Overview

This project serves as a complete PayloadCMS solution designed for integration into any Docker Compose stack. It provides a full-stack CMS including backend API, frontend interface, and intelligent content generation capabilities through n8n workflow automation.

**Modular Design**: This system can be easily plugged into existing Docker Compose environments, providing instant CMS capabilities without disrupting your current infrastructure. The internal Docker networking ensures seamless integration with other services in your stack. Just change `proxy-payloadcms-to-your-n8n-network` in the docker-compose file to the docker network with your n8n instance.

## Architecture

### Content Generation Workflow

1. **Chat Input** ‚Üí n8n receives natural language prompt
2. **AI Processing** ‚Üí n8n Ollama node processes prompt using structured system prompt
3. **JSON Structuring** ‚Üí Python parser converts AI output to PayloadCMS format
4. **Post Creation** ‚Üí Express API creates draft post using PayloadCMS blocks
5. **Editorial Review** ‚Üí Draft posts await manual review and publishing

### Key Components

- **PayloadCMS v3** - Modern headless CMS with block-based content editing
- **Express API Server** - Custom API endpoint for automated content creation (port 3001)
- **n8n Integration** - Workflow automation for AI-driven content generation
- **MongoDB Database** - Persistent data storage with Docker volumes
- **Structured AI Prompts** - Intelligent content formatting and organization

## Quick Start

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Run the automated setup
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Monitor Startup Process

Watch the container logs to know when the server is ready:

```bash
# Monitor logs until you see "Ready for n8n integration!"
docker compose logs -f payloadcms-app
```

Wait for these key messages:
- `üöÄ Starting PayloadCMS development server...`
- `‚úÖ Content generator API server is healthy`
- `üîå Ready for n8n integration!`

### Access and Configuration

1. **Visit the application** at your server address (displayed during setup)
   - Default: http://localhost:3000
   - You'll see the default page recommending you visit `/admin`

2. **Create your admin user** at http://localhost:3000/admin
   - Fill in your admin credentials
   - You'll be automatically signed in and redirected to the admin dashboard

3. **Run the database seed** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED for Content Generation API**
   - On the admin landing page, look for the seed instructions
   - Click the "Seed your database" option to populate with demo content
   - This creates sample posts, media, and navigation content
   - **The content generation API requires seeded demo content to function properly**

### Reset and Clean Start

```bash
# Complete cleanup - removes all containers, volumes, and data
./scripts/manage.sh cleanup

# Fresh setup (completely clean state)
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This cleanup process resets everything to a pristine state, removing all demo data and allowing you to start fresh without any cleanup overhead.

### Access Points
- **PayloadCMS Admin**: http://localhost:3000/admin
- **Public Site**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Endpoint**: http://payloadcms-app:3001/api/create-post (internal Docker network)

## Content Generation Integration

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The content generation API requires a seeded database to function properly. Demo content provides the media assets, categories, and user accounts needed for automated post creation.

### System Prompt
The AI uses a comprehensive system prompt (`./data/payloadcms/tools/payloadcms-content-generator/system-prompt.md`) that:
- **Structures AI Output**: Guides language models to generate consistent JSON format
- **Defines Content Hierarchy**: Ensures proper use of headings, paragraphs, and specialized blocks
- **SEO Integration**: Prompts for optimized meta titles and descriptions
- **Block Variety**: Encourages diverse content blocks (code, banners, media) for engaging posts
- **Context Awareness**: Tailors content complexity and style to the prompt topic

The system prompt acts as a contract between your n8n workflow and the content generator, ensuring predictable, well-formatted output regardless of the AI service used (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.).

### Python Parser
The n8n Python parser (`./data/payloadcms/tools/payloadcms-content-generator/python-parser.py`) serves as the critical bridge between AI output and PayloadCMS:

- **Data Validation**: Ensures AI-generated JSON matches PayloadCMS schema requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Handles malformed AI output gracefully with fallback formatting
- **Block Transformation**: Converts generic content blocks into PayloadCMS-specific structures
- **Field Mapping**: Transforms metadata into proper PayloadCMS field formats
- **Sanitization**: Cleans and validates content for safe database insertion

This parser is essential because AI output, while structured, often needs refinement to match PayloadCMS's exact requirements for block types, field names, and data structures.

### Express API
The integrated Express server (running on port 3001) processes validated JSON payloads and creates draft posts using PayloadCMS's native block system:

**Supported Content Blocks:**
- **Rich text content blocks** - Paragraph content with Lexical formatting
- **Code blocks** - Syntax highlighting for 12+ programming languages
- **Heading structures** - H2/H3 organizational hierarchy
- **Banner notifications** - Info, warning, error, and success callouts
- **Media blocks** - Automatic assignment from existing media library
- **SEO metadata** - Meta titles, descriptions, and social sharing optimization

**API Features:**
- **Draft Creation**: All posts created as drafts for editorial review
- **Health Monitoring**: `/health` endpoint for workflow verification
- **Debug Endpoints**: Validation and testing tools for development
- **Error Handling**: Detailed logging and error reporting for troubleshooting

### Database Seeding Requirement

The content generation API is designed to work with PayloadCMS's demo content structure. **Database seeding is required** for proper operation because:

- **Media Assets**: Hero images and media blocks require existing media in the database
- **User Accounts**: Posts need valid author assignments from seeded user accounts
- **Category Structure**: Content categorization relies on demo categories
- **Reference Data**: The API expects a populated content ecosystem for optimal functionality

**How to Seed:**
1. Complete the initial setup and admin user creation
2. Visit the admin dashboard and follow the seeding instructions
3. Verify content generation API functionality with the populated database

This design ensures the content generation system has rich, realistic data to work with, creating more professional and complete automated posts.

### n8n Workflow Setup

#### 1. Ollama Node Configuration
- **Model**: Use any suitable model (llama3.1:8b recommended)
- **System Prompt**: Include the content from `system-prompt.md`
- **User Prompt**: Pass through from your chat trigger or input

#### 2. Python Parser Node
- **Script**: Use the provided `python-parser.py`
- **Input**: Raw Ollama output
- **Output**: Validated JSON matching PayloadCMS schema

#### 3. HTTP Request Node Configuration
```
Method: POST
URL: http://payloadcms-app:3001/api/create-post
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
